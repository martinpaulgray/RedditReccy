This project is a React app that allows viewers to view and search through Reddit, using their API data.

Created for a Codecademy project on the Full Stack Engineers course, It's a very simplified version, but this seems to work so I'm happy.
Looking at some of the other solutions to this project on GitHub - I haven't used as much code, so I may revisit this later and do some additional work.

Tasks yet to complete:
Convert Markdown to display in HTML
Build test units using Jest and Enzyme
Adapt layout to be more 'mobile-friendly'
Find a way to display a default image if one isn't available
